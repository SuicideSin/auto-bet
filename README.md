========

auto-bet script for www.bitdice.me, www.litedice.me, www.dogedice.me, and www.reddice.me

**_Please note_, this script was intended for bitdice.me and only tested on bitdice.me and reddice.me. Use this script at your own risk. I am not respondible for any gains OR losses. This script is only tested in Firefox and Chrome, using the addons listed below.**

The script has been updated to automatically load the latest version of the auto-bet script any time you go to a supported website.

You will need to have the [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) addon in Chrome, or the [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) addon in Firefox.

Please [use this userscript](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SystemDisc/auto-bet/master/auto-bet.user.js). Just click on the link. Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey will prompt you to allow the script to be installed.
